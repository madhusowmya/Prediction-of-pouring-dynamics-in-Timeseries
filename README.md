Robot cooking is an active and important research
area. One of the most common object manipulations required
while cooking is pouring. While humans are easily able to
intrinsically learn how to perform pouring by repeated practice
over time, robotic systems need to use mathematical calculations
to understand the manipulation of pouring a container. By
creating intelligent deep learning models which are able to
accurately determine the output rotation angle and rotation
velocity needed to pour a certain amount of liquid, it is possible
to implement the act of pouring with a robot. This project
demonstrates the different techniques necessary in order to
learn how to pour. In the end, multiple Long Short Term
Memory cells will be used in for the deep learning model. This
project is able to achieve a final loss training loss 0.00068 and 
validation loss of 0.0010.
